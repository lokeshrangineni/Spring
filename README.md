# Spring

* Used spring batch framework because it is extendable and provides lot of functionalities out of the box.
* Spring batch itself provides multi threading capabilities however i have used custom multi threading just because for the additional points.
* Added unit tests for couple of methods to prove that i am familier with writing unit test cases.If it is required to write unit test cases for any specific method please let me know.
* This application assumes that each event is in one line on the log file so currently using FlatFileStreamReader. We can extend spring batch to implement any custom logic.
* Please feel free to reach out to me for any questions.
